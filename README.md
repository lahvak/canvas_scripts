Some python scripts for the Canvas learning management system

The Canvas course managment system by Instructure has a RESTful API that allows easy access to a number of features.

These are some scripts that allows an instructor to interact with the system from the command line, to do things like
get a class roster, post an anouncement, create a class syllabus from a source written in markdown, add links to course 
navigation that redirect to external websites, etc.
